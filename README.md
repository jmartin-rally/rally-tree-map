rally-tree-map
=================

Quick test to see if we can create a treemap.  The sizes of the boxes are related to the plan estimates; colors are based on state.  Double-click an epic to zoom in.  Right-click to zoom out.

No idea what happens with large data sets.  Could do something better about the naming and sizing.
